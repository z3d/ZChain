# ZChain
This started out as a personal learning project to understand how Blockchain technology works.

It was inspired by [Everything You Wanted To Know About Blockchains, Parts 1](https://unwttng.com/what-is-a-blockchain) and [2](https://unwttng.com/what-is-bitcoin-ethereum).

I'm also using the solution to explore other aspects of .NET Core, and new C# concepts.
